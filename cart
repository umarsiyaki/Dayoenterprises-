To address the absence of buyer-specific features, storage facilities, and advanced settings, Iâ€™ll provide a comprehensive implementation plan. Here's an enhanced version with **buyer tracking**, **persistent storage**, and **advanced settings**.

---

### **Enhanced Requirements**

1. **Buyer Identification**:
   - Assign a unique identifier for each buyer.
   - Allow buyers to log in or register (basic implementation).

2. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Use `localStorage` or a backend API for storing cart data.
   - Cart data should persist even after the page reloads or the user navigates to other pages.

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Tax, shipping, and promotional rules based on buyer location or preferences.
   - Cart summary and history for tracking previous orders.
   - Settings to manage:
     - Cart capacity (e.g., max number of items).
     - Automatic removal of inactive items.
     - Vendor-specific settings.

### **Improved Implementation**

#### **Back-End Setup (Optional for Advanced Storage)**

- Use a backend API built with `Express.js` or similar.
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /cart` to save cart data.
  - `GET /cart` to fetch cart data.
  - `POST /login` to authenticate buyers.

#### **Full-Featured JavaScript Implementation**

```javascript
```

### **New Additions**

1. **Buyer Tracking**:
   - Each buyer gets a unique `buyerId` stored in `localStorage`.

2. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Cart data is saved in `localStorage` with a buyer-specific key (e.g., `cart_buyer_123`).

3. **Advanced Settings**:
   - Promo code management.
   - Shipping rules based on cart items.
   - Tax applied dynamically.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Easily integrates with a backend API for real-time sync across devices.

### **Suggested Enhancements**
To go further:
- **Add Authentication**: Allow buyers to log in and fetch saved carts.
- **Implement Wishlist and Compare**: Expand the current design to handle these features.
- **Backend Database**: Use SQL or NoSQL to store cart data securely.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSockets for live cart updates.
